## 🔑 Key Concepts Mastered

### 1. Persona Assignment
I learned that an AI needs a "Role" to set the correct tone and expertise level.
* *Example:* "You are a Senior Customer Experience Engineer."

### 2. Delimiters (The "Boxes")
I practiced using XML-style tags and triple quotes to separate my instructions from the raw data. This prevents the AI from getting confused.
* *Syntax:* `<customer_email> [Text] </customer_email>`

### 3. Few-Shot Prompting
I discovered that providing 1–2 examples of a "Perfect Answer" drastically increases the consistency of the AI's output.

### 4. Chain of Thought (The "Secret Sauce")
By using the phrase **"Let's think step by step,"** I learned how to force the AI to show its logic, making it much more accurate for complex tasks like travel itineraries or budgeting.

## 🛠 Project: The Travel & Support Automator
This week, I built a prompt that handles:
1. **Sentiment Analysis** (Detecting if a customer is angry/happy).
2. **Data Extraction** (Pulling dates and budgets from travel notes).
3. **Constraint Management** (Keeping replies under a strict 18-word limit).

## 🚀 Next Steps
* Begin deep-dive into **[LearnPrompting.org](https://learnprompting.org)** modules.
* Explore **Prompt Chaining** (linking multiple prompts together).
* Start documenting "Failures" to show how I troubleshoot AI hallucinations.
