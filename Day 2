📔 Learning Log: Week 1 – Day 2: Prompt Chaining & Data Extraction

Date: December 2025

Goal: Transitioning from single-prompt tasks to multi-step AI workflows.

🔑 Key Concepts Mastered
1. Data Extraction (The "Cleaner")

I learned how to use a Technical Researcher persona to strip away "noise" from raw text (like news articles) and extract only the essential facts (Problems, Demographics, Solutions).

Impact: This makes the data ready for professional analysis without the AI getting distracted by extra words.

2. Prompt Chaining

Instead of asking the AI to do everything at once, I learned to break tasks into a "Chain."

Step A: Clean and extract data.

Step B: Use that specific data to generate creative solutions.

Why: This prevents "hallucinations" and significantly increases the quality of the final output.

3. Contextual Reasoning

I combined Chain of Thought ("Think step by step") with Prompt Chaining to ensure that new ideas are logically tied to the original problem and the target audience.

🛠 Project: The "Sleep Tourism" Case Study
I successfully built a two-step chain:

Prompt A: Extracted core problems (stress/sleep deprivation) and demographics (executives/parents) from a travel article.

Prompt B: Used that data to invent a "Bio-Acoustic Sleep Pod" for home use, proving that AI can bridge the gap between a trend and a new product idea.

🚀 Next Steps
Learn Negative Constraints (preventing the AI from making specific mistakes).

Explore "Temperature" and Parameter Settings (controlling AI creativity).

Update GitHub repository with these chained prompt templates.

"One big prompt is a conversation; two small prompts are a system."
